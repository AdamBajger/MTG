Marvelous Trading Game

This is really an original idea with non-profit target,
to make our own, fully functional trading card game.
We are learning from other games and we are, of course, copying working mechanics,
but whatever! We are just learning Java, anyone can join (just write to me)

Maybe if we will manage to create some open-source project, they won't sue us
for being annoying :D
